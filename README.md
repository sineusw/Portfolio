Week Two Homework

This is my first portfolio. In this portfolio I will display my new skill pertaining to a navigation bar, links to external websites, informational text input, inputting titles and headers, as well as correctly using media quarry.


This was the first big assignment and I was determined to meet all the criteria that this assignment had to offer. This assignment was extremely challenging as it pushed me to keep on try even in the mists of failure.

What makes my project unique is how I statically have the layout of all the text, pictures, and navigation bar on the left side of the website therefor causing minimum effort when scrolling through my website.
