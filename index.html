<!-- this is my paragraph about me -->
         <p style="text-align: left;" class="aboutText">Born in Florida, raised in a small town. Graduated From Lecanto High School in 2012. Attended Howard Community College the following year, participating in the Decathlon as a Track Athlete. Went on to move to Hawaii in 2017 that lead to finding a passion for nature, beach activities, and the the great blue ocean. While in Hawaii there were a few skills obtained such as Spearfishing, Hiking rigorous hikes, most certainly not excluding a spontaneous skydiving excursion. In the mists of Hawaii there were International travels to Australia, once in 2018 and 2019. As well as a most recent trip to Brazil early in the great year of 2020. Currently a student at Georgia Institute of Technology after deciding to give vacation time a break to focus on a promising career. After completing Georgia Techâ€™s Coding Bootcamp the next goal will be using this new set of coding skills in finding and obtaining a remote Software Engineering job to where travel and work can no longer be separated as a distant dream but reality. </p>
